                    <h2>Understanding the Regulatory Landscape in Care:</h2>
<p>Ensuring all aspects of your care planning and provision are compliant with national regulatory standards is essential in health and social care.</p>
<p>As a result, care compliance software is at the forefront of all aspects of care, from ensuring compliance with regulatory standards to streamlining operations.</p>
<p>In April 2024, the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Care Quality Commission</a> (CQC), the regulatory body for care providers in the UK, launched a single assessment framework across all health and social care providers that assesses providers on 5 main areas to ensure the care provided is safe, responsible, well-led, capable, and effective.</p>
<p>Upon inspection by the CQC, any providers who receive an inadequate rating have 6 months to improve their service before being re-audited.</p>
<p>This is to ensure that all issues are effectively dealt with in a timely manner, which provides protection to service users’ and their families.</p>
<p>In Ireland, care providers are also assessed by a regulatory body, the <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Health Information and Quality Authority</a> (HIQA), which evaluates care providers on 8 main criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>person-centred care and support,</li>
<li>effective care and support,</li>
<li>safe care and support, better health and wellbeing,</li>
<li>leadership, governance and management,</li>
<li>workforce,</li>
<li>use of resources, and</li>
<li>use of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of April 2022, HIQA implemented a new inspection and monitoring programme which will require all care providers to be audited every 2-3 years.</p>
<p>If a care provider fails to meet the established regulatory standards, they will be provided recommendations to improve their service to assist them to meet the required standards, and in extreme cases, they may be unable to operate until they are re-audited and meet the established standards.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Compliance in Care:</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been significant increase in the number of individuals in receipt of care, with the Department of Health &amp; Social Care UK projecting that the number of individuals aged 65 and over that will require care in 2038 will increase by 57% when compared to 2018.</p>
<p>According to the Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), there are currently over 27,00 individuals in receipt of care in care homes, and whilst there has been no official projection for the future, the Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO) has reported that the number of individuals aged 65 and over in 2031 will increase by 24% when compared to 2023, whilst PWC projected the population of individuals aged 85 and over will more than double in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>With this projected growth and the increased governmental focus on compliance, many providers are opting to implement care compliance software to enable them to consistently provide a fully compliant service to their service users.</p>
<p>Care compliance software comes packed with functionality designed to assist providers in providing a fully compliant service to their clients, such as robust reporting capabilities, a centralised reportable document repository, and an internal audit checklist to enable care providers to pre-audit their service prior to a HIQA/CQC inspection.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to legally operate care providers must first register with their national regulatory body and are then independently audited to ensure they meet the required standards to operate.</p>
<p>Here’s where care compliance software comes in, as many care providers utilise the internal audit checklist and reporting functionality to ensure they meet the regulatory standards prior to inspections.</p>
<p>Ensuring their care service remains fully compliant promotes trust and safety within their organisation for both the care staff and their service users and guarantees a high standard of ethical behaviour is maintained by staff. Compliance also ensures a certain standard of safeguarding for both carers and service users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by remaining fully compliant, care providers ensure that there is a consistent standard of care being provided to service users, which increases the levels of trust between the care providers, the service user and the service users’ family as they know they will receive the same standard of care, regardless of which carer is providing the care.</p>
<p>When there is a high level of trust between the service user and their carers, service users are more likely to actively engage with their care which significantly improves their care outcomes, whilst also allowing them to have more input on the care they are receiving.</p>
<h2>Key Compliance Challenges Faced by Care Providers:</h2>
<p>As the number of individuals in receipt of care continues to increase, care providers are also seeing a significant increase in their workload, resulting in many carers having to work long hours, often in difficult conditions, leading to many becoming burnt out and leaving the industry.</p>
<p>Moreover, unless the care providers have implemented a <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/home-care">care management software</a>, carers are expected to memorise large volumes of data which significantly increases the likelihood of them making a mistake when providing care and increases the chances of key information being lost with one carer.</p>
<p>Service users with complex care requirements can also pose a significant compliance challenge to a care provider if their requirements require highly specialised training. If a carer with the required training is unavailable or calls in sick, the service user may not receive the correct care, which could be potentially life threatening in some cases.</p>
<p>Care providers must also regularly undergo re-training in key areas of care provision along with any other specialised training they have previously completed, or they will be ineligible to continue providing care.</p>
<p>Whilst many care providers have implemented a compliance software that notifies them when a carers training certifications are due to be renewed, care providers using traditional paper-based methods of providing care have to monitor this manually, which increases the administrative burden on both the carer and the care provider.</p>
<p>As the number of service users continues to grow, so does the associated amount of required paperwork. As a result, care providers that haven’t implemented care compliance software may struggle to maintain accurate records of care provided, medications administered, and other critical care information, resulting in them failing to comply with national regulations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, service users’ must have their own personalised care plans that are reviewed and updated regularly based on their present care requirements and their desired care outcomes.</p>
<p>When done manually, this process can be very time consuming for care staff and ultimately increases their administrative burden, increasing the likelihood that will become burnt out and subsequently leave the industry, and in many cases can result in providers increasing their spend on hiring and training additional care staff in an attempt to reduce the administrative burden their current staff may be facing.</p>
<h2>How Care Compliance Software Streamlines Healthcare Compliance:</h2>
<p>Implementing a care compliance software can help streamline care provision whilst also ensuring that the care being provided is fully compliant with national regulations.</p>
<p>Care compliance software comes packed with functionality such as a centralised document repository, pre-audit checklists, and a centralised storage for client and carer data, all designed to streamline care provision and reduce the administrative burden faced by care providers.</p>
<p>All client records are stored centrally, meaning that all key stakeholders can access the data at any time and are informed of any changes to the care being provided to a client in real time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as client records are stored centrally, carers are notified periodically when a client’s care plan needs to be updated to better reflect their desired care outcomes.</p>
<p>Traditionally this process required a significant time investment from care providers as they would have to manually plan, write, and print each clients care plan.</p>
<p>However, care compliance software has robust care planning functionality that includes highly configurable care plan templates that allow carers to create and update a client’s care plan with just a few taps, and as a result can spend more time doing what they do best, providing high quality care.</p>
<p>As this information is stored centrally, it allows for swift and remote access and sharing of service user data in case of an emergency whilst also reducing the possibility of important client information being lost in one carers mind, ultimately reducing the pressure faced by care staff to memorise large volumes of data which greatly increases levels of staff satisfaction.</p>
<p>Care compliance software also comes with a centralised document repository, storing key documents such as policies and procedures, prescriptions, and highly configurable document templates, allowing care staff to easily create and update documents as needed whilst also ensuring they remain fully compliant with national regulations.</p>
<p>One of the key regulatory requirements for care provision is ensuring staff are fully qualified and up to date with their trainings. As a result, many care compliance software’s provide care coordinators with a dashboard that displays an overview of all their staff and their qualifications.</p>
<p>This enables care coordinators to identify when a staff members qualification is about to expire allowing them to notify the affected carer and schedule a re-fresher training course. As a result, care coordinators can ensure their staff are always up to date on their specialised training, meeting the national regulatory requirements.</p>
<h2>The Future of Care and Embracing Compliance to Provide Effective Care:</h2>
<p>As the number of individuals receiving care continues to increase, ensuring that all aspects of care planning and provision are compliant with national regulatory standards is more important now than it ever has been before.</p>
<p>This increase has seen many care providers pivoting away from traditional paper-based methods of care planning and provision towards more advanced methods, with many implementing care compliance software, such as ours.</p>
<p>Care compliance software comes packed with functionality designed to assist care providers meet their respective national regulatory requirements whilst also increasing their operational efficiency and reducing the administrative burden they face, allowing them to do what they do best, providing high quality care.</p>

                    <h2>Trends in Modern Domiciliary Care and the Need for Advanced Software Solutions:</h2>
<p>In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of individuals that require <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/home-care">domiciliary care</a>. This trend looks set to continue with the Department of Health &amp; Social Care in the UK predicting that 57% more adults aged 65 and over in England will require care in 2038 compared to 2018.</p>
<p>This increased demand has highlighted the need for domiciliary care management software as care providers are facing more and more pressure to provide the best possible standard of care with fewer resources.</p>
<p>As a result, many care providers have pivoted from traditional or paper-based care management methods towards advanced software solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/home-care">Domiciliary care management software</a> has a wide range of functionality to assist carers in providing a high standard of care as it enables them to have all the information they need at their fingertips.</p>
<p>This means that they no longer have to focus on remembering large volumes of information and can instead redirect their full focus on doing what they do best, providing excellent care to their service users.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Excellence in Domiciliary Care:</h2>
<p>One of the most important things to individuals receiving domiciliary care is the ability to remain in their own homes. Being in familiar surroundings, can help to maintain a certain level of independence they otherwise wouldn’t achieve if they were in a residential care facility.</p>
<p>Being in their own home allows for service users to maintain their daily routines, meaning they can get up at their preferred times, eat the foods they like, and do the daily activities they enjoy, which ultimately encourages them to take on a more active role in their care leading to better care outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, when service users receive care from a team of carers in a familiar location, such as their own home, they build a deep sense of trust with the care team where they know they are going to receive excellent care, ultimately increasing their satisfaction with the service and improving their care outcomes.</p>
<p>As the number of service users continues to increase, so does the administrative burden faced by care providers, resulting in operational efficiency becoming one of the most critical aspects of care provision.</p>
<p>Once the number of service users hits a certain size, it becomes increasingly difficult for administrative staff to manually create and distribute schedules, produce new care plans, and record key compliance indicators.</p>
<p>Moreover, as care staff are providing care to multiple service users in their own home, it’s crucial that they remain fully compliant with national care standards, such as HIQA regulations in Ireland and CQC and the Care Inspectorate regulations in the UK.</p>
<p>To achieve excellence in domiciliary care, it is fundamental that care providers implement a domiciliary care management software to reduce the administrative burden they face by streamlining the creation and distribution of care plans, rosters and schedules whilst remaining fully compliant with regulatory standards.</p>
<h2>Challenges Faced by Domiciliary Care Providers:</h2>
<p>With growing demand and a continuously increasing waiting list, care providers may find it difficult to deliver care that is compliant with the various regulatory standards without a robust care management software.</p>
<p>As domiciliary care providers typically visit multiple locations to provide care for service users, one of the biggest challenges they face is ensuring that there’s adequate buffer time between calls to allow them time to travel from one client to another.</p>
<p>Care providers may not have access to their own private vehicle so may need to rely on public transport to get them from client to client, which can result in them being late or even missing a shift if there’s delays caused by traffic, or they need to coordinate multiple transfers to reach their destination.</p>
<p>Moreover, if a service user is living in a rural location, carers without access to their own private vehicle may find it difficult to visit the client and which significantly reduces the roster of carers who can deliver care to the service users.</p>
<p>Another major challenge faced by domiciliary care providers is the high rate of staff turnover caused by limited budgets, long hours, and often difficult working conditions.</p>
<p>A high rate of staff turnover can have a disastrous knock-on effect for service users as care coordinators may not have enough staff with the correct training to assign coverage and as a result, the service user may not receive the care they require.</p>
<p>As some individuals in receipt of domiciliary care services have complex care requirements, they may require more than one carer to provide care at any given time.</p>
<p>This can be challenging for care coordinators as some cases require carers to have specialist training to carry out certain aspects of care plans and as a result, it can be difficult to find coverage if carers do not have sufficient specialist training.</p>
<p>Traditional scheduling methods are a very manual process that requires a significant time investment from care coordinators as they have to manually write and print each carers schedule and distribute them to their staff.</p>
<p>Additionally, if a carer calls in sick or is unable to attend a client, care coordinators have to manually re-write, print and distribute the schedules again, sometimes with just mere minutes notice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there are changes made to a service users’ care plan, the service users’ family isn’t always informed which can significantly damage the trust between their family and their care providers.</p>
<p>If a carer is late or misses a visit with a client it can have potentially life-threatening implications for the service user, as they may require time sensitive medication or require 24/7 assistance.</p>
<p>Moreover, if carers aren’t on time for their next shift or miss a shift, the previous carer will have to wait until someone turns up to provide coverage which can have a knock-on effect for service users and their families.</p>
<p>Another major challenge facing domiciliary care providers is the tremendous amount of pressure they face to remember large amounts of data regarding multiple service users.</p>
<p>As such, there’s a high likelihood that the care providers will forget key information about the service users which increases the gaps in care outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, if an incident occurs that requires emergency assistance, care providers have to manually pass on all the key information regarding the service user, however, they may forget key information or there may be too much information to provide a clear overview of the service users’ care requirements, further increasing gaps in care provision.</p>
<h2>How Software Solutions Address These Challenges:</h2>
<p>Implementing a domiciliary care management software can help address these challenges in several ways, one of which being with advanced geofencing functionality.</p>
<p>Geofencing prevents carers from clocking-in to their shift when they are outside of a certain radius from the service users’ home, ensuring that they are where they are when they say they are.</p>
<p>As a result, service user’s and their families have an increased level of trust with their care providers which encourages them to be more engaged with the care being provided and ultimately reduces the gaps in care provision.</p>
<p>Domiciliary care management software also brings with it extensive digital care planning functionality, which enables carers to create templated care plans that are highly configurable, which significantly reduces the time it takes for carers to create and make changes to a service users care plans.</p>
<p>Moreover, digital care plans are stored centrally, meaning carers no longer have to remember large amounts of data to provide a high quality of care.</p>
<p>As a result, care providers are under significantly less pressure, meaning they are better equipped to do what they do best, providing excellent care.</p>
<p>The advanced scheduling and rostering functionality within domiciliary care management software also helps to minimise the challenges faced by care staff by providing a robust set of tools to assist them when creating, updating, and distributing weekly schedules.</p>
<p>One of the main tools helping them achieve this is the wallchart functionality. A wallchart provides a complete overview of carers weekly schedules and can be updated at a moment’s notice thanks to its drag and drop capabilities, allowing care coordinators to make instant changes to a carers schedule, and as they are stored centrally within care plans, all key stakeholders in the service users care provision are immediately notified as soon as the change is made.</p>
<p>When a change needs to be made to a carers schedule, the wallchart will provide care coordinators with a list of the most suitable coverage based on a number of criteria, such as distance to the client, methods of transport, and completed trainings to name just a few.</p>
<p>Wallcharts also come equipped with ‘tag scheduling’ functionality, which allows care coordinators to create ‘tags’ that they can then associate with the service user based on their care requirements whilst also being able to create and associate corresponding training tags with care staff.</p>
<p>These tags are then used to assign the most suitable carer to the service user based on their care requirements and the trainings the carer has completed.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We really like that the system provides a comprehensive view of both carers and clients. With the system capability for immediate updates and managerial oversight, operations have become more efficient and accurate.&#8221; &#8211; David Wallace, Director of Strategy and Operations, Hibernia Home Care.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, care coordinators also have the ability to create templated schedules that can be duplicated and edited with ease.</p>
<p>This significantly reduces the administrative burden faced by admin staff as they can create schedules weeks in advance and can easily make changes on the go with just a few taps.</p>
<p>Domiciliary care software also allows coordinators to optimise carers ‘run’ schedules in a way that’s the most efficient for the carer, ensuring that the service user receives the correct care at the correct time.</p>
<p>This significantly reduces the likelihood of a service user not being administered time sensitive medication or missing a time sensitive treatment as the care providers have sufficient buffer time between calls to ensure they reach their next client in a timely manner.</p>
<p>When a carer is providing care to the service users on their run, they are prompted to perform key care deliverables ensuring they are delivered at the correct time and recorded accordingly.</p>
<p>This data can automatically be fed into the auditing and reporting functionality of your domiciliary care management software, which can then be used to ensure the care provided is fully compliant with national standards.</p>
<h2>Looking to the Future and Embracing Excellence in Domiciliary Care:</h2>
<p>Due to the growing number of individuals in receipt of domiciliary care, traditional methods of care provision are becoming increasingly unsustainable, emphasising the need for care providers to pivot away from traditional methods of care provision towards more advanced methods.</p>
<p>As the number of individuals in receipt of domiciliary care continues to grow, it’s becoming increasingly important that all care provided is fully compliant with national regulations, which has led to the emergence of many domiciliary care software’s, such as ours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, domiciliary care management software has a wide range of functionality designed to streamline care planning and delivery, ensuring service users receive a high standard of care whilst simultaneously increasing staff satisfaction as care providers are no longer required to memorise large chunks of information about a client, and can instead focus on doing what they do best, provide excellent care.</p>
<p>The increased requirement for operational efficiency, staff satisfaction, and most importantly personalised care that is fully compliant with national regulations, has led to us offering cutting-edge functionality such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage medication stock cabinets for all users, ensuring no medication administration is missed with customisable due/late reminders and alerts,</li>
<li>A centralised document repository suite with a full library of pre-configured reports which are highly customisable and downloadable with a full audit trail, and</li>
<li>Full self-service ability for care providers to manage their payslips, annual leave, sick leave, and any additional leave required, directly from their own mobile phone.</li>
</ul>

                    <h2>Why Traditional Scheduling Methods Fall Short in Modern Care Settings :</h2>
<p>Traditionally, <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/scheduling">care staff scheduling</a> has been a notoriously manual and complicated process for administration staff to complete.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach for service users and carers alike and the unpredictability of the care industry’s day-to-day activities means it can be difficult to plan for all eventualities.</p>
<p>To ensure a high standard of care and operational efficiency are achieved and maintained at all times, administrative staff have begun to adopt a more proactive approach to employee scheduling through leveraging advanced scheduling solutions.</p>
<p>Advanced <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/scheduling">care staff scheduling software</a> solutions allow for care staff to proactively plan ahead and enable real-time scheduling changes to be made, with all stakeholders being notified as soon as a change is made.</p>
<p>By moving away from a reactive approach to care employee scheduling, and towards a more proactive scheduling approach, care organisations can significantly reduce their administrative burden, allowing carers to focus on what they do best, getting the right care, to the right person, at the right time.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Efficient Staff Scheduling:</h2>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles in effective care scheduling is ensuring that the service users receive the highest quality of care that is tailored to their individual needs.</p>
<p>By ensuring that the carer has the required training or skills for the service user’s individual needs and verifying that there are no gaps or missed calls, administrative staff can ensure that clients receive the right care at the right time.</p>
<p>Additionally, regularly scheduling a client with the same team of care providers, can encourage them to engage with their care in a meaningful way as it builds a good rapport and trust between all stakeholders involved, empowering them to take on a more active role in their health-related decision-making process.</p>
<p>This familiarity can also help to minimise the stress clients may feel when using the service, further enticing them to interact in a meaningful way with their care.</p>
<p>As the number of service users increase, efficient staff scheduling becomes one of the most critical aspects of care coordination. Once the number of service users hits a certain size, it becomes increasingly difficult for care staff to effectively retain all the necessary client information, resulting in gaps in care provision.</p>
<p>Recognising the challenge this brings, care providers have gradually begun to shift towards using more advanced software solutions to manage their staff scheduling.</p>
<p>One of the added benefits of the right software for care organisations is that all carer and service users’ information is stored centrally and can be accessed at any time during the scheduling process.</p>
<p>As a result, care providers are better able to allocate their resources, scheduling carers with the client they are best suited to, ultimately improving care outcomes.</p>
<h2>Challenges in Traditional Scheduling Methods:</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges of using traditional or paper-based scheduling methods for care employee scheduling is the significant time investment that is required to plan, develop, and distribute each carers weekly schedule. Whilst it may be feasible for some smaller care providers to effectively use a paper schedule, for the vast majority, traditional scheduling methods are too time consuming to be considered a sustainable long-term approach to their scheduling.</p>
<p>Digital schedules allow slight changes to be made quickly and communicated to all staff and service users at the click of a button.</p>
<p>For example, if a carer calls in sick, traditionally, management will have to find suitable coverage, edit the schedule and re-distribute it amongst carers with little to no buffer time, whereas using advanced software solutions for your care staff scheduling allows for instant scheduling changes to be made with all key stakeholders to be instantly notified of any changes to their schedules. <em>“We really like that the system provides a comprehensive view of both carers and clients. With the systems capability for immediate updates and managerial oversight, operations have become more efficient and accurate. This transition has minimised delays and enhanced the overall quality of care delivered to clients.” – David Wallace, Director of Strategy and Operations, Hibernia.</em></p>
<p>Additionally paper-based schedules often mean that client information is printed out, which can be costly if there needs to be multiple revisions to the schedule. Worse still, it can leave you open to potential data breaches if the paper schedules are lost, misplaced or stolen.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the client information is not stored centrally, rather on spreadsheets or in folders, it greatly increases the likelihood of vital information regarding a client’s health being lost in one person’s mind, which brings its own set of problems if said carer falls ill or ceases employment.</p>
<h2>Key Features of Advanced Scheduling Software:</h2>
<p>To reduce the gaps in care provision brought about by paper-based scheduling methods, advanced scheduling software should allow care coordinators to create templated schedules which can then be automated to create efficient and error-free schedules for staff.</p>
<p>As these schedules can be templated and subsequently automated, it reduces the administrative burden on care staff by speeding up the scheduling process.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, scheduling software should come with drag-and-drop wallchart functionality, that provides an overview of each carers schedule, which allows for coordinators to make real-time changes, with any changes communicated out to all stakeholders as soon as a change is made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, apart from instantly notifying all stakeholders of any changes, coordinators can then update the schedule in the carer’s app or email the revised schedules to all staff, resulting in greater staff satisfaction as they no longer have to manually email each affected carer, rather they just make the required changes, knowing everyone will be automatically notified.</p>
<p><em>“Having access to something like the wall chart for example, is a great help. If someone calls in sick, it allows us to check what visits they had for that day and allocate them to others quickly and easily. It’s just a case of dragging and dropping and that makes a big difference.” – Carly Trevett, Registered Manager, Agincare.</em></p>
<p>The emergence of AI and machine learning in care industry, specifically within the care management software ecosystem, has further opened the door for new advanced functionality to be developed, such as providing carers with a summary of all the comments in a client’s care plan, run-route optimisation, and time-route optimisation.</p>
<p>Incorporating AI and machine learning into care scheduling can help streamline operations and reduce the overall administrative burden on staff by generating a list of suitable carers that can cover a shift, which administrative staff can then use to assign coverage.</p>
<h2>Additional Benefits of Implementing Scheduling Software:</h2>
<p>Along with all of the above, you want your software to also enable care coordinators to further streamline their scheduling by using pre-defined tags when assigning staff shifts.</p>
<p>This practice should provide a percentage match between carers and service users, empowering coordinators to match service users with the most suitable caregiver, enhancing the quality of care delivered.</p>
<p>Additionally, coordinators have the ability to add care notes and task lists to carers schedules, prompting them to perform and record key care components for effective care delivery, ensuring that they have a clear audit trail for care provision and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>This audit trail can be used to further inform the development of service-user’s care plans and streamlines your preparations for CQC/HIQA inspections.</p>
<p>Moreover, implementing software to manage your scheduling enables coordinators to ensure that there are always enough qualified staff readily available to provide high quality, personalised care.</p>
<p>As a result, care staff are less likely to experience burnout during their day-to-day work as shifts are distributed fairly amongst staff, ensuring that no individual carer is being overworked, simultaneously increasing the quality of care provided and levels of staff satisfaction.</p>
<h2>The Next Steps in Steps in Care Scheduling and Embracing Technology for a Brighter Future:</h2>
<p>Due to the constant growth and the unpredictable nature of the care industry, traditional/paper-based scheduling methods have become increasingly non-viable due to their lack of flexibility and the unrealistic time investment required by administrative staff.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the number of service users increases, maintaining efficient staff scheduling becomes critical in providing high quality personalised care that is tailored to individual users’ needs, whilst also making carers more efficient in their care delivery.</p>
<p>As a result, care providers are moving away from more traditional and reactive methods of scheduling, towards more contemporary, proactive means of care staff scheduling, which has led to the emergence of advanced care management systems, just like ours.</p>
<p>The increased requirement for proactive scheduling, increased staff efficiency and personalised care provisions has led to us working on some cutting-edge technological enhancements and AI tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Route optimisation for service delivery to provide an optimal schedule based on the carer’s current postcode, ensuring staff efficiency whilst continuing to service user’s preferences, and</li>
<li>Automatically assigning leave cover by identifying the most suitable worker for the client based on coordination data and service delivery history.</li>

                    <h2>The Shift to Digital Care:</h2>
<p>The care industry has seen a major transformation over the past decade, resulting in a gradual shift away from traditional paper-based care planning, with electronic care planning becoming the new norm. In recent years, the increased requirements for personalised care and the rise of smart phones, has emphasised the benefits of using <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/care-planning">digital care plans</a> over traditional paper-based care plans.</p>
<p>Digital care plans streamline the creation of comprehensive and personalised care plans, ensuring efficient and tailored care provisions for individuals, whilst reducing the time carers spend creating care plans, allowing them to do what they do best, provide excellent care. Moreover, the rise of smart phones in recent years has underscored the benefits of electronic care planning by enabling carers to access digital content on-the-go, keeping them fully informed and connected with essential resources.</p>
<p>The advent of the NHS’s Digital Shared Care Record programme, which provides funding for care organisations to move away from paper-based care records has also helped to accelerate and smooth the transition. <a href="https://beta.digitisingsocialcare.co.uk/assured-solutions/onetouch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OneTouch are, of course, DSCR assured suppliers</a> and we have assisted hundreds of carer organisations make the shift to digital care plans.</p>
<h2>Understanding Digital Care Plans:</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/carers">Carers</a> ultimately spend a large amount of their time away from their home or nurse stations providing care, so they don’t have the bandwidth to be writing up timely paper-based care plans, this is where electronic care planning comes in!</p>
<p>Digital care plans are the electronic version of traditional paper care plans, that are used to determine the type and level of care required for each client. These plans can be templated and are highly configurable, allowing for efficient care provision planning tailored on a person-to-person basis, significantly reducing the time staff spend developing care plans.</p>
<p><em>“I think most staff would say the time spent with service users has improved since we introduced OneTouch. I think this is because when you’re not looking for paperwork and finding different records and forms and writing and signing, carers have more time to spend caring!&#8221; – Julie, Registered Manager, County Durham Care &amp; Support.</em></p>
<p>Apart from being an efficient method for creating care plans, electronic care planning enables carers to be immediately notified of any changes whilst providing a detailed log of any changes, track their compliance with policies, and provide a matrix report that assists both staff and clients monitor the completion dates across multiple plans. Moreover, implementing digital care plans into care provision empowers your staff to carry out their job more effectively, reducing the pressure they face daily, and ultimately reducing the likelihood of errors occurring.</p>
<h2>Key Benefits of Digital Care Plans:</h2>
<p>Traditionally, carers have had to rely on multiple, interconnected solutions to achieve their goals and provide a high level of care for their clients, however OneTouch Health is unique in the care management software ecosystem, as we are the only true <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/solution">all-in-one care management software</a> on the market, allowing care providers to build a meaningful relationship with a single solution provider. With OneTouch’s digital care planning functionality, carers can see their schedules in advance and update their actions on the go with just a few taps in our carer app.</p>
<p>All client records are stored centrally, meaning that all key stakeholders can access the data at any time and are informed of any changes to the clients records and scheduling in real-time. By centralising this knowledge, and making it easily accessible for the key stakeholders, carers no longer have to retain significant amounts of information, resulting in less mistakes occurring as carers are able to focus on providing the best possible standard of care as they have instant access to the service users current and legacy medical information.</p>
<p>Additionally, centralising client data enables carers to create and modify their schedules in advance, empowering them to spend more time engaging with a client on a more personal level resulting in better care outcomes. One of our customers, David Wallace, Director of Strategy and Operations at Hibernia commented:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“We really like that the system provides a comprehensive view of both carers and clients. With the systems capability for immediate updates and managerial oversight, operations have become more efficient and accurate. This transition has minimised delays and enhanced the overall quality of care delivered to clients.”</em></p>
<p>The digitisation of care management combined with a centralised data storage system enhances visibility into care provision and significantly reduces the gaps in service delivery. This is accomplished through the use of a wall chart, which is an overview of all the care being provided during that period.</p>
<p>As the wall chart is stored centrally, all stakeholders will be notified in real-time when a change occurs. Furthermore, as the client’s medical history and personal data is also stored centrally, their care plans can be accessed remotely to retrieve any necessary data, enabling the rapid deployment of personalised reactive care.</p>
<h2>Impact on Client Engagement and Self-Management:</h2>
<p>The digitisation of care management has also impacted how clients engage with their care plans and the extent to which they’re managing their own health-related decisions. As we’ve already established, digital care plans are a terrific way of providing personalised care to clients, and to increase critical care efficiencies.</p>
<p>However, to achieve the highest possible standard of care provision, the client needs to be empowered to engage with their care, take on a more active role and become involved in their health-related decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Digital care plans empower service users to take a more active role in their care by providing them with access to their care plan, where they can manage their care, track their progress and communicate with their care providers. One of the ways in which service users interact with their care is by keeping a digital diary.</p>
<p>Digital diary entries facilitate the structured and thoughtful approach to recording a service user’s daily activities, allowing them to reflect on their experiences throughout the day. These entries can be shared with key stakeholders and can be used to plan out future care plans.</p>
<p>Moreover, as care plans have to be reviewed periodically, daily diary entries allow for a greater level of involvement from the client when it comes to creating future care plans, whilst also allowing care staff to spot any trends that may be occurring, adjusting the care provided accordingly.</p>
<h2>Looking to the Future and Embracing Digital Transformation in Healthcare:</h2>
<p>The care industry has seen major transformations over the past decade, with a gradual shift away from traditional paper-based care planning, with electronic care planning becoming the new norm. The digitisation of care management, fuelled by unprecedented technological advancements and the ever-growing requirement for personalised care, had led to the emergence of many digital care management systems, such as <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/">OneTouch Health</a>.</p>
<p>However, unlike other providers in the care management software ecosystem, OneTouch is the only true all-in-one care management software on the market. We have positioned ourselves as an industry leader in the healthcare market which is integral in delivering the best service of care provision to end-users.</p>
<p>As a result, we are continuously working on cutting edge technological enhancements and tools such as AI to improve on areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarising Client data over a period of time to identify trends and patterns in behaviours or care delivery to help make informed assessments,</li>
<li>Route optimisation for service delivery to provide the efficient scheduling format while continuing to consider Client preferences, and</li>
<li>Auto assigning leave cover using all the coordination data and service delivery history to find the most suitable worker for the Client.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>OneTouch streamlines the process of meeting Care Quality Commission (CQC) requirements and preparing for your inspections. At the most basic level our system ensures that all necessary documentation and procedures are organised and readily available, making it easier for your organisation to demonstrate compliance during inspections. You can even create specific logins for inspectors to give them access to the documentation that they need to see. There are some key areas we excel in as follows:</p>
<h4>Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting</h4>
<p>With OneTouch, you can monitor your staff and organisational compliance in real-time, ensuring that you and your opration adhere to CQC standards at all times. The platform provides instant reports and analytics, allowing you to address any issues promptly and effectively before they become problems. We have developed a suite of reports specifically for reporting to the CQC in the UK. These reports can be bookmarked to specific pieces of data available on the system.</p>
<h4>Efficient Record-Keeping</h4>
<p>OneTouch maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date record of all compliance-related activities. This ensures that all necessary documentation is available for inspectors, reducing the time and effort required to prepare for CQC visits. The platform supports full digitalisation, removing the dependence on paper while allowing reports to be printed if necessary, helping to decrease the carbon footprint of your organisation.</p>
<h4>Customisable Checklists and Audits</h4>
<p>The platform offers customisable checklists and audit tools tailored to CQC standards. This feature helps ensure that all required processes are followed consistently, making it easier to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements during inspections. OneTouch&#8217;s CQC Audit Repository page allows users to store relevant system links pertaining to specific guidelines within categorised CQC headings.</p>
<h4>Staff Training and Compliance Tracking</h4>
<p>OneTouch includes tools for tracking staff training and ensuring that all team members meet the necessary qualifications and certifications. This is crucial for demonstrating compliance with the CQC’s staffing requirements. Using the training features <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/carers">on our Carer App</a> provides 24/7 access to training and support documents, supporting the Commission&#8217;s vision to adopt “dignity and client respect” principles.</p>
<h4>Incident Management</h4>
<p>The incident management feature allows you to record, track, and resolve any incidents quickly. This not only helps in maintaining compliance but also provides a clear record for CQC inspectors to review, demonstrating your commitment to quality and safety.</p>
<h4>Centralised Compliance Dashboard</h4>
<p>OneTouch provides a centralised dashboard where all compliance-related activities and data are displayed. This makes it easier to oversee compliance efforts, track progress, and provide evidence of compliance during CQC inspections.</p>
<h4>Enhanced Person-Centred Care</h4>
<p>The platform was developed to provide person-centred care, with an eForm builder allowing customisable forms to be configured as required by your organisation. A library of forms can be developed and becomes accessible against each client’s profile, available for all users in real-time as forms are completed. Real-time evidence of care is delivered by reviewing notes and updates made against the service user’s profile.</p>
<h4>Continuity of Care</h4>
<p>Continuity of care is supported by displaying the number of hours each carer delivers each week. Using the preferred carer feature ensures staff can be linked with service users on a continued basis. Continuity reports allow services to be monitored, ensuring visits are regularly scheduled with the right staff to build rapport and confidence.</p>
<h4>Permissions and Access Control</h4>
<p>There is a permissions group called &#8220;CQC Audit&#8221; containing permission variables &#8220;CQC Access&#8221; and &#8220;Add CQC Page,” allowing top-level administrators to set access permissions appropriate to the role of each user. Records can be shared in real-time with any user given access, as appropriate.</p>
<h4>Future-Proofing Service Delivery</h4>
<p>The agility and scalability of the OneTouch platform support the delivery of flexibility to meet the changing needs of service users. Assistive technology can be linked to the platform to help future-proof service delivery.</p>
<h4>Comprehensive Auditing Tools</h4>
<p>OneTouch goes beyond merely demonstrating compliance with our CQC Audit Tool, allowing care homes to showcase their excellence. It centralises evidence from diverse sources within the OneTouch ecosystem, streamlining the demonstration of outstanding practices across safety, care, responsiveness, effectiveness, and leadership. Customisable categories, centralised documentation, and regular updates make the inspection process easier and more comprehensive.</p>
<p>By leveraging the comprehensive features of OneTouch, your organisation can meet CQC standards efficiently and effectively, demonstrating your commitment to providing high-quality care. If you are based in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland all of the above functionality can also be adapted to the requirements of the Care Inspectorate Wales, Care Inspectorate Scotland or the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority as needed.</p>

<p>Excitement is building around OneTouch as we&#8217;re busy getting ready for our next event &#8211; the Care Show at Excel, London. We look forward to welcoming you all to Stand K42. If you are going to be at this event please do stop by to say hello and learn exactly what the <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/solution">OneTouch Solution</a> can do to help your care organisation.</p>
<p>We also can&#8217;t wait to see our very own Head of Strategy, Richard Green, deliver a keynote presentation on the &#8216;Use of Technology to Nurture and Build Human Connections in Care Organisations&#8217;. We&#8217;ll hope to see you all there at the Keynote Stage at 1:45 pm on the 25th April!</p>
<p>Richard will be taking a look at the nuanced human advantages of embracing a <a href="https://www.onetouchhealth.net/">Digital Care Management system</a>. With a remarkable professional trajectory spanning from initial roles to managerial positions within care organisations, Richard brings invaluable insights into the transformative effects of technology on individuals within the care sector.</p>
<p>Having experienced the transition from paper-based to fully digital solutions first hand, Richard will shed light on the often unheralded benefits of digitisation across various dimensions of social care. Richard will also demonstrate how our system goes beyond mere time and cost savings, offering efficiency gains, operational enhancements, and fostering positive cultures within care organisations.</p>
<p>During this session, you&#8217;ll gain insights into the diverse advantages offered by OneTouch, while also understanding the multitude of HR benefits associated with adopting it as your preferred supplier. Richard&#8217;s extensive experience and expertise make him a well-respected figure in the healthcare industry.</p>
